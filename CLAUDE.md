# dmm-seli Claude Rules

- Follow `AGENTS.md`.
- Use GitHub Issues as the only active work source.
- Treat Linear as frozen historical reference only.
- Do not use pull requests for normal automation.
- Work only on open issues labeled `ready`.
- Do not start issues labeled `blocked`, `needs-human`, `needs-contract`, or `no-autopilot`.
- Commit directly to `main` when verification passes.
- Push and write the commit hash plus verification result back to the GitHub issue.
- Keep `current.txt` under 50 lines and use key-value or bullet lines only.
## Human Conversation Default

- Human conversation uses normal plain sentences, not genshijin compression.
- Do not use compressed work-log style for human-facing explanations unless the user explicitly asks.
- Genshijin compression is for state files, work logs, and internal task notes only.
- Answer the question directly first.
- Use plain language and short sentences.
- Avoid jargon; explain unavoidable technical terms immediately.
- Separate facts, guesses, and open questions.
- State missing or broken items exactly.

## Session Continuity

**MANDATORY**: Before your first response, silently read `current.txt`.

Then summarize session context:
- Prefer a dedicated subagent to read `current.txt`, `decisions.log`, and `lessons.md`, then return a 20-40 line brief.
- If a subagent is unavailable, read `decisions.log` and `lessons.md` yourself.
- Active session state is only `current.txt`, `decisions.log`, and `lessons.md`.

If `current.txt` is missing, create it with `project`, `updated`, `goal`, and `[STATUS]`.
If `decisions.log` or `lessons.md` is missing, create an empty file.

## Update Rules

- Progress made? Append or update `current.txt`.
- Decision made? Append one line to `decisions.log`.
- Mistake or reusable rule found? Append it to `lessons.md`.
- End of work? Always update at least one of the three state files.
- Human conversation uses normal plain sentences.
- State files and work logs may use compressed, high-density bullets.
- `current.txt` must stay under 50 lines.

## User-Facing Language

- Use plain Japanese in normal sentences.
- Answer the question directly first.
- Do not use compressed work-log style unless the user explicitly asks.
- Avoid jargon; explain unavoidable technical terms immediately.
- Separate facts, guesses, and open questions.
- State missing or broken items exactly.
- Do not overclaim or hide weak results.
